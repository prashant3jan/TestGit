## Use case

Setting the initial viewpoint is useful when a user wishes to first load the map at a particular area of interest. 

## How to use the sample

As the application is loading, the initial view point is set and the map view opens at the given location.

## How it works

1. Create an `ArcGISMap`.
2. Create a `Viewpoint` using an `Envelope`.
3. Set the starting location of the map with `setInitialViewpoint(Viewpoint)`.
4. Set the map to a `MapView`.
